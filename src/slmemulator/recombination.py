    Conceptual implementation of the recombination thinning process based on the paper.
    This function aims to find a sparse solution x' to the linear system Ax = y.

    Args:
        A_matrix (np.array): The matrix A in the linear system Ax = y.
                             In the context of GRIM, this matrix relates features and
                             linear functionals.
        y_vector (np.array): The vector y in the linear system Ax = y.
                             In the context of GRIM, this relates to the target function
                             evaluated by linear functionals.
        initial_solution_x (np.array, optional): An initial solution vector x. If None,
                                                  a least squares solution is computed.
        tolerance (float): Tolerance for numerical stability, especially for SVD and
                           checking non-zero components.

    Returns:
        np.array: A sparser solution vector x' for the system Ax = y.
                  Returns None if the system is inconsistent or other issues.
